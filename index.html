    <h1>Carlos Rodriguez Resume</h1>
    <h2>QA Tester / Automation Engineer</h2>
    <a href="./public/contact-me.html">Here is my Contact Information!</a>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      Dedicated and detail-oriented software tester with over 2 years of
      experience in Quality Assurance, specializing in both manual and automated
      testing. Known for strong analytical skills, keen perception, and a
      meticulous eye for detail, I am adept at identifying and troubleshooting
      issues quickly and accurately to ensure the highest standards of software
      quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have hands-on experience with test automation tools like Selenium and
      Appium, which I use to create and execute efficient, reusable test scripts
      that improve testing accuracy and save time. My expertise in test
      frameworks such as JUnit and TestNG allows me to structure and manage test
      cases effectively, while tools like Postman and REST Assured help me
      ensure API integrity and reliability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I prioritize clear and effective communication, working closely with
      developers, designers, and other QA team members to provide thorough and
      precise documentation of any issues and bugs. My goal is not just to find
      problems but to collaborate with the team in resolving them, contributing
      to the creation of high-quality, user-friendly software. With a commitment
      to continuous learning and improvement, I bring a proactive approach to
      every project, always aiming to enhance testing processes and maintain
      software excellence.
